# libmath
Simple lineal algebra library to test different optimization techniques. **IMPORTANT**, this library is under heavy development.

## How to use
As it's a header only library, just move the `src/` folder into your include path. It's important to enable intrinsics on the compiler, on GCC just add `-msse4.2` as a compilation flag.
